/**
 * Fused letterbox → CHW float32 pipeline with reusable buffers.
 *
 * The composable primitives in {@link ./image.js} each allocate and each walk
 * their input end to end, which is the right shape for a library but the wrong
 * shape for a video loop. Chaining them costs eleven full-buffer passes and six
 * large allocations per frame:
 *
 * `getImageData` → RGBA→RGB → RGB→RGBA → `putImageData` → `drawImage` →
 * `getImageData` → RGBA→RGB → fill → row copies → `toFloat32` → `toCHW`.
 *
 * This module collapses the second half of that into two: one `drawImage` that
 * resizes *and* positions the content inside the padded target in a single
 * accelerated operation, and one loop that reads the resulting RGBA and writes
 * planar float32 directly. The intermediate `RGBImage` at target size, the fill
 * loop, the row copies and the two 4.9 MB `Float32Array` allocations all go
 * away.
 *
 * The primitives stay exactly as they are — they are public API and they are
 * what makes a custom pipeline writable. This is the fast path the built-in
 * tasks take.
